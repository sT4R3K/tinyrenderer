1. Bresenhamâ€™s Line Drawing Algorithm
    * [0.1](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/0.1) : First attempt.
    * [0.2](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/0.2) : Second attempt.
    * [0.3](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/0.3) : Third attempt.
    * [0.4](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/0.4) : Forth attempt.
    * [0.5](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/0.5) : Fifth attempt.
    * [1.0](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.0) : Final attempt.

2. Triangle rasterization and back face culling
   * [1.1](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.1) : Line sweeping (triangle's bottom part).
   * [1.2](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.2) : Line sweeping (filled triangle).
   * [1.3](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.3) : Line sweeping (less readable version).
   * [1.4](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.4) : A better method (using barycentric coordinates).
   * [1.5](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/1.5) : Flat shading render (clown-colors).
   * [2.0](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/2.0) : Flat shading render (adding lighting).

3. Hidden faces removal (z buffer)
   * [2.1](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/2.1) : Y-Buffer (rendering a 2D scene on 1D screen).
   * [2.2](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/2.2) : Z-Buffer (Back to 3D).
   * [3.0](https://github.com/sT4R3K/tinyrenderer/tree/3.0) : Texture!
   
4. Perspective projection
